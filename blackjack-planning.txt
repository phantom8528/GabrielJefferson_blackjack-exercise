Canvas, Module 3, In-Class: BlackJack Exercise
-------------------------------------------------------
Step.1) Familiarize yourself with the html and the Class

- branch2-ticket2: after viewing the html and css provided in the orginal clone, 
create a new BlackJack html, css, and js file that will contain all of your work. 
The HTML will contain the following elements.
--->container Class
--->row 1: will be for the scoreboard and the applicaiton logo
--->row 2: will be for the dealer label and the dealer name should one be prompted.
--->row 3: will be for the dealer side of the table which will eventually hold the cards for 
the dealers cards. 
--->row 4: will be for the player label and the player name, should one be prompted.
--->row 5: will be for the player's side of the table which will eventually hold the player's 
cards.
--->row 6: will hold the "Deal", "Hit", and "Stand" buttons. 

Step.2) Style The page

- branch3-ticket3: Go into the css and style the elements to either the specifications of the 
assignment or to your own customized specifications.
--->labels and scoreboards will be styled black and grey. 
--->player and dealer tables will be styled light green with dark green borders
--->NOTE: ask instructor if we can style the css to our own specifications.

Step.3) Cards on the table

-branch4-ticket4: hard-code the card images into the html document. we can use 
javascript to add the right cards later. Then we will link (set src attribute) to card images in 
the folder.

Step.4) Dealing the cards

-branch5-ticket5: go into js file and create an eventListener to each of the buttons.

--->The "deal" button eventListener must do the following:
* create a new image elements
* match it with the corresponding object inside of the array holding the cards
* appends it to the player's hand and the dealer's hand (empty array).

--NOTE--
The deal button should only be pressed 4 times: once for the twice for the player, 
and twice for the dealer. 

--NOTE--
The second card dealt to the dealer is supposed to face-down. This needs to be communicatd to the 
javascript code. 
---> Possible Solution: 
* press the "deal" button three times (twice for the player, and once for the dealer). 
* When the user presses "hit" or "stand", the second card is dealt and the calculation is made
in order to determine a winner. 

--->The "hit" button eventListener must do the following:
* create an image element
* match the image with the corresponding object in the array
* appends the image to the player's hand 

--->The "stand" button eventListener must do the following:
* If create an image element
* match the element with corresponding object in the dealer's hand (array)
* appends the image to the dealer's hand

Step 5.) Image from cards

-branch6-ticket6: create a function that matches the images in the given file folder
to its corresponding object in the array(s) holding the player hand and the dealer hand. 

--->Name of function will be called: getCardImage();

Step.6) Render Hands

-branch7-ticket7: create a function that takes the card (which has alredy been matched with its 
corresponding objeect) and renders it onto the html

Step 7) Shuffle The Deck

-branch8-ticket8: create a seperate function that shuffles the deck of cards 
created by the buildDeck() function declared and instantiated earlier

--NOTE--
the name of this function will be: shuffleDeck()

Step 8) Calculate the points

-branch9-ticket9: create a seperate function that calculates the points for the 
player's hands and the dealer's hands 
-->It is within this function that "WINS" and "BUSTS" will be determined. 
-->this will be printed, along with the corresponding integer score.
-->If conditions are met for a winner, all other functionality will be rendered null 
and the only option will be to restart the game.

--NOTE--
the name of this function will be: calculatePoints()

Step 10) Display points

-branch10-ticket10: create a seperate function that displays the results
returned by the calculatePoints function declared before.

--NOTE--
the name of this function will be: displayPoints()

Step 11) Restart the game 

-branch11-ticket11: create a fourth button called reset, which corresponds to the 
funciton that does what is implied. Until a winner is chosen, this button will be
be disabled.

--NOTE--
the name of this function will be: resetGame()

--------------------------AMENDMENTS AND UPDATES TO THE PLAN------------------------------------


--------------------------Branch 2: HTML & CSS, Ticket 2------------------------------------

Decided to deviate from the html provided in the original clone down. 

I've also provided a logo for the black application. 

CSS for "blackjack.html" will be provided next

Update to the notes also provided.


--------------------------Branch 3: CSS, Ticket 3------------------------------------

CSS provided for the html previously pushed. 

Design deviates from what was originally cloned down.

Commented out placeholders for cards in the html in order to test DOM Javascript placement
dynamically. 

--------------------------Branch 4, Ticket 4: ------------------------------------

Instead of adding cards with javascript, I used html and css to hard-code the playing card images 
into the tables. 

With current html settings, the tables for both the dealer and the player can comfortably
hold 12 cards. 

Javascript will conditionals will reflect limitations for how many cards can be put onto the 
tables.

--------------------------Branch 5, Ticket 5: ------------------------------------

Created eventListener for the "Deal" button. 

Recording included as demonstration.

Used the same card for the test / demonstration.

--------------------------Branch 6, Ticket 6: ------------------------------------

Plan being amended to do the following:
--> Amending the dealCards function to account for the player's hand and to account 
for the number of cards required for each at the beginning of a game. 

-->Update: dealCards given a parameter to accomodate multiple players, should 
multiplayer functionality be added later on.

-->Update: dealerFaceDown function created in order to account for a BlackJack rule:

"One of the two cards dealt to the dealer must be facedown until the end of a given round"

-->Update: dealCardsRender function created to maintain the number of cards dealt to the dealer 
and the player when the "Deal" button is clicked.
When the deal button is clicked, four cards are dealt (2 to the dealer, 2 to the player), with
one of the cards for the dealer being facedown (due to the dealerFaceDown function being called).

--------------------------Branch 7, Ticket 7: ------------------------------------

-->Update: eventListeners added for "Hit" and "Stand" buttons
-->Update: playerHit function assigned to hit button listener. Adds a card 
to the player's hand when ever clicked.
-->Update: Created variables for card generation
-->Update: Created function to generate cards and instance of the buildDeck function.
-->Update: Created a function to extract random card from the deck generated
